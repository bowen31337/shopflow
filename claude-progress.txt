   Priority Order (from feature_list.json):

   a) Backend server startup (Features #1-2)
   b) Database schema creation (Feature #3)
   c) Sample data seeding (Feature #4)
   d) User authentication (Features #5-10)
   e) Product catalog API (Features #11-33)
   f) Search functionality (Features #34-39)
