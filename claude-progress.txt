=============================================================================
SHOPFLOW E-COMMERCE PLATFORM - AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS
=============================================================================

SESSION 1: INITIALIZATION (COMPLETED)
Date: [Initial Session]
Agent: Initializer

COMPLETED TASKS:
✅ Read and analyzed complete project specification (app_spec.txt)
✅ Created comprehensive feature_list.json with 200 detailed test cases
✅ Created init.sh setup script for automated environment setup
✅ Initialized git repository
✅ Created basic project structure (server/, client/ directories)
✅ Created comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
✅ Created .gitignore file
✅ Made initial git commit

PROJECT FOUNDATION:
-------------------

1. FEATURE LIST (feature_list.json)
   - 200 comprehensive test cases
   - Mix of functional and style/UI tests
   - 25+ tests with 10+ steps for comprehensive coverage
   - Covers all aspects: authentication, products, cart, checkout, reviews, admin
   - All tests start with "passes": false
   - Organized by priority (fundamental features first)

2. SETUP SCRIPT (init.sh)
   - Automated project initialization
   - Installs backend dependencies (Express, SQLite, JWT, bcrypt, Stripe)
   - Installs frontend dependencies (React, Vite, React Router, Zustand)
   - Generates JWT secrets automatically
   - Creates .env file with secure defaults
   - Provides clear instructions for starting servers

3. PROJECT STRUCTURE
   shopflow/
   ├── server/
   │   ├── src/              (ready for backend code)
   │   └── database/         (ready for SQLite database)
   ├── client/
   │   ├── src/              (ready for React components)
   │   └── public/           (ready for static assets)
   ├── feature_list.json     (✅ Complete with 200 tests)
   ├── init.sh              (✅ Ready to use)
   ├── README.md            (✅ Comprehensive documentation)
   └── .gitignore           (✅ Proper exclusions)

4. DOCUMENTATION (README.md)
   - Quick start guide
   - Complete feature list
   - Technology stack details
   - Database schema overview
   - Design system specifications
   - Environment variables guide
   - Development workflow
   - Success criteria

READY FOR NEXT SESSION:
-----------------------

The next agent should:

1. RUN INITIALIZATION:
   ./init.sh

2. START BACKEND DEVELOPMENT:
   Priority Order (from feature_list.json):

   a) Backend server startup (Features #1-2)
   b) Database schema creation (Feature #3)
   c) Sample data seeding (Feature #4)
   d) User authentication (Features #5-10)
   e) Product catalog API (Features #11-33)
   f) Search functionality (Features #34-39)
   g) Shopping cart API (Features #40-58)

3. DEVELOPMENT APPROACH:
   - Work on ONE feature at a time
   - Test thoroughly before marking "passes": true
   - Follow the priority order in feature_list.json
   - Commit frequently with descriptive messages
   - NEVER remove or edit features from feature_list.json

4. TESTING STRATEGY:
   - Follow the step-by-step instructions in each feature
   - Mark "passes": true ONLY when fully verified
   - Use actual testing, not assumptions
   - Test both happy path and edge cases

CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR FUTURE SESSIONS:
---------------------------------------

⚠️  NEVER REMOVE FEATURES from feature_list.json
⚠️  NEVER EDIT feature descriptions or steps
⚠️  ONLY change "passes" from false to true when verified
⚠️  Work sequentially on features in priority order
⚠️  Commit progress before context window fills up
⚠️  Update this progress file at end of each session

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
-----------------
Backend:  Node.js, Express, SQLite, better-sqlite3, JWT, bcrypt, Stripe
Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Router, Zustand, React Hook Form
Ports:    Backend: 3001, Frontend: 5173

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Run ./init.sh to set up dependencies
2. Create server/src/index.js for Express server
3. Create database schema initialization
4. Seed sample product data
5. Implement authentication endpoints
6. Start marking features as passing

Current Features Passing: 0 / 200
Target: Production-ready e-commerce platform
